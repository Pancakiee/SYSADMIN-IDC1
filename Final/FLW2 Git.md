# SYSADM1 -- Git Basics

Answer the following research questions about Git, GitLab desktop and
GitHub.

1.  **What is Git, and why is it important in software development?\
    **- Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle
    everything from small to very large projects with speed and
    efficiency. It allows multiple developers to work on a project
    simultaneously without interfering with each other\'s changes. Git
    is crucial in software development because it enables collaboration
    within developers as they work together on the same codebase,
    merging their changes seamlessly whether in they're in their
    offices, or different locations. It allows Version Tracking where
    every changes that is made on the code is recorded, allowing
    developers to revert to previous versions if needed. It also enables
    Branching & Merging where developers can create branches to
    experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase,
    which can later be merged back into the main project.

2.  **How does Git track changes in a project?\
    **- Git works by taking snapshots of the project's file system to
    track changes over time. The staging area is where you prepare
    changes by selecting files with \`git add\`. This step allows you to
    decide which modifications to include in the next commit. Afterward,
    using \`git commit\`, Git records a snapshot of the files in their
    current state, storing it along with a unique commit hash, author
    information, and timestamp, creating a permanent record of that
    version in the project history.

3.  **What is the difference between a local repository and a remote
    repository in Git?\
    **- A local repository is the version of a project stored on a
    developer\'s own computer. It allows developers to make changes,
    commit updates, and create branches independently, without affecting
    others. This gives each developer the freedom to work on their tasks
    without interference. A remote repository, on the other hand, is
    hosted on a server, such as GitHub or GitLab, and acts as a central
    hub for the entire team. It's where developers can push their
    changes to share with others and pull updates made by their
    teammates. The remote repository ensures that everyone stays in sync
    and can collaborate efficiently on the same project.

4.  **What are the basic Git commands?\
    **- git init: Initializes a new Git repository.\
    - git clone \<url\>: Copies an existing remote repository to your
    local machine.\
    - git status: Shows the current state of your working directory and
    staging area.\
    - git add \<file\>: Stages changes to be included in the next
    commit.\
    - git commit -m \"\<message\>\": Commits the staged changes with a
    message.\
    - git push \<remote\> \<branch\>: Uploads your local commits to the
    remote repository.\
    - git pull \<remote\> \<branch\>: Fetches and merges changes from
    the remote repository.\
    - git branch: Lists branches or creates a new branch.\
    - git checkout \<branch\>: Switches to a different branch or
    restores files.\
    - git merge \<branch\>: Merges changes from one branch into
    another.\
    - git log: Shows the commit history.\
    - git remote: Manages remote repositories (view, add, remove).\
    - git reset: Unstages changes or removes commits.\
    - git rm \<file\>: Removes files from the working directory and
    stages for deletion.\
    - git diff: Shows the differences between changes in the working
    directory and the staged changes.

5.  **How do you check the status of a Git repository?\
    **- To check the status of the a Git repository, we use "git
    status", this command display information about staged files,
    unstaged changes, untracked files and which branch you are currently
    on.**\
    **

6.  **What is the purpose of branches in Git, and how do you create and
    switch between them?\
    **- Branches in Git allow developers to work on different features
    or fixes simultaneously without affecting the main codebase usually
    called main or master.

> Creating a Branch: Use the command: git branch \[branch-name\]\
> Switching Between Branches: git checkout \[branch-name\]
>
> Alternatively, you can create and switch to a new branch in one
> command: git checkout -b \[branch-name\]

7.  **What are GitLab Desktop and GitHub, and how are they different
    from Git?\
    **- GitLab Desktop and GitHub are platforms that provide hosting for
    Git repositories. They offer additional features beyond version
    control, for GitHub, it is prrimarily known for its social coding
    features, it allows users to collaborate on projects through pull
    requests, issues tracking, and project management tools. On the
    contrary GitLab offers similar functionalities but emphasizes
    continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) capabilities
    directly integrated into its platform. Although both platforms
    facilitate collaboration they differ in their specific tools and
    community features**\
    **

8.  **How do you connect a local Git repository to a GitLab or GitHub
    repository?\
    **- To connect your local repository to a remote repository on
    GitHub or GitLab:\
    Create an empty repository on your chosen platform.\
    In your local repository, run: git remote add origin \[url\]\
    Push your local commits to the remote repository: git push -u origin
    master\
    This sets up your local repository to track changes against the
    remote one.**\
    **

9.  **What are the steps to collaborate with others using GitLab or
    GitHub?**

    a.  **Set Up Your Repository**

        i.  Create an Account: If you don\'t have one, sign up for
            GitHub or GitLab.

        ii. Create a New Repository: Click on \"New Repository\" and
            provide a name and description. Choose whether it should be
            public or private.

        iii. Initialize with a README: This helps provide context about
             the project.

    b.  **Invite Collaborators**

        i.  GitHub:

        ii. Navigate to your repository\'s main page.

        iii. Click on the Settings tab.

        iv. Under the Access section, click on Collaborators.

        v.  Click on Add People, enter their GitHub username or email,
            and send the invitation.

        vi. GitLab:

        vii. Go to your project page.

        viii. Click on Members in the sidebar.

        ix. Enter the username or email of the person you want to
            invite, select their role (e.g., Developer), and click
            Invite.

    c.  **Clone the Repository**

        i.  Collaborators should clone the repository to their local
            machine using:\
            git clone
            https://github.com/yourAccountName/your-repo-url.gi

    d.  **Create a Branch**

        i.  To avoid conflicts, collaborators should create a new branch
            for their work:\
            git checkout -b feature-branch-name

    e.  **Make Changes and Commit**

        i.  After making changes to files, add them to the staging area
            and commit:\
            git add .\
            git commit -m \"Description of changes\"

    f.  **Push Changes to Remote Repository**

        i.  Push your changes to the remote repository:\
            git push origin feature-branch-name

    g.  **Open a Pull Request (GitHub) / Merge Request (GitLab)**

        i.  After pushing changes, open a pull request (PR) on GitHub or
            a merge request (MR) on GitLab:

        ii. Go to the repository page and click on Pull Requests
            (GitHub) or Merge Requests (GitLab).

        iii. Click on New Pull Request/Merge Request, select your
             branch, and provide details about your changes.

    h.  **Review and Merge Changes**

        i.  Collaborators can review the PR/MR and discuss any necessary
            changes. Once approved, merge it into the main branch.

    i.  **Sync Changes Regularly**

        i.  Regularly pull changes from the main branch to stay
            updated:\
            git pull origin main

10. **How do you resolve merge conflicts in Git?\
    **- Merge conflicts occur when two branches have competing changes
    that cannot be automatically merged. To resolve them:\
    Attempt to merge branches using: git merge \[branch-name\]\
    \
    If conflicts occur, open the conflicting files and look for markers
    (\<\<\<\<\<\<\<, =======, \>\>\>\>\>\>\>) indicating conflicting
    areas.\
    Edit these sections manually to resolve conflicts.\
    After resolving conflicts, stage the changes: git add \[file\]\
    Complete the merge with: git commit\
    \
    This process ensures that all conflicting changes are addressed
    before finalizing the merge.

11. **What is a pull request, and why is it used in GitHub?\
    **- A pull request (PR) is a request by a contributor to merge their
    branch into another branch (usually main or master). It serves
    several purposes which include facilitates code review by allowing
    team members to discuss proposed changes before they are merged. It
    helps maintain code quality by enabling checks like automated tests
    before integration. Lastly, it provides documentation of what was
    changed and why through comments associated with each PR

12. **What are some best practices for writing commit messages?\
    **- Best practices for writing effective commit messages include:\
    Use Imperative Mood: Write messages as commands (e.g., \"Add
    feature\" instead of \"Added feature\").\
    Be Concise but Descriptive: Summarize what was changed in 50
    characters or less; use more detail in subsequent lines if
    necessary.\
    Reference Issues: If applicable, reference issue numbers related to
    your commits for context.
