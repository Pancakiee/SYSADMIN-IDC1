> ## **Course Reflection**

What were your initial expectations for the course? Did the course meet,
exceed, or fall short of these expectations?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
> I expected to learn basic system administration concepts like managing operating systems, networks, and servers. It turned out to be much more than just theory, as the hands-on activities allowed me to directly apply what I learned. The practical approach exceeded my expectations because it felt like I was solving real-world problems rather than just completing assignments.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What were the main topics or concepts covered in the course? How did
these topics contribute to your understanding of the subject matter?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
> We covered a wide range of topics, including creating file systems, managing services in both Windows and Linux, setting up web servers, and using Git for version control. Each topic helped me understand the importance of system administration in maintaining reliable and secure systems. For example, learning about Kerberos authentication gave me insights into how secure login systems work in large organizations.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Reflecting on your learning process, what were the most effective
strategies or techniques that helped you grasp and retain the course
material?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
> The hands-on activities were the most effective part of my learning process. Doing tasks step by step helped me fully understand what I was working on, like setting up servers or troubleshooting issues. Researching topics like Kerberos and group discussions also helped me think more deeply about what I was learning and made it easier to remember the material.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Were there any particular assignments, projects, or activities that
significantly enhanced your learning experience? Why were they
effective?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
> One of my favorite assignments was creating the portfolio through GitHub. It felt like web designing, which is something Iâ€™ve always found interesting. Organizing my work into a portfolio made me proud of what I had accomplished and motivated me to put more effort into my tasks. I also enjoyed learning how to manage services in Windows and Linux, which taught me how to control different parts of a system.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Did you encounter any challenges or difficulties during the course? How
did you overcome these obstacles, and what did you learn from them?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
> One of the biggest challenges for me was setting up monitoring tools on the virtual machine to track printer activities. It required configuring multiple settings and ensuring everything worked properly, which was both time-consuming and technical. Similarly, configuring the web server took a toll on me big time, especially in ensuring that the client could access and view the web page created on the server. Both tasks demanded attention to detail, troubleshooting skills, and persistence. I tackled these challenges by following guides, collaborating with classmates, and repeatedly testing configurations to resolve issues. These experiences taught me the importance of patience, teamwork, and resilience when dealing with complex technical setups.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Did the course encourage critical thinking and analysis? How did it
promote higher-order thinking skills, such as problem-solving or
decision-making?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
> Yes, the course encouraged critical thinking and analysis, particularly during tasks like setting up monitoring tools on the virtual machine and configuring the web server. Both activities required me to troubleshoot complex issues, such as resolving errors in monitoring printer activities and ensuring the client could view the web page created on the server. These tasks pushed me to analyze problems in detail, consider different solutions, and make decisions on how to approach them effectively. By solving these challenges, I developed higher-order thinking skills, including problem-solving and decision-making, which are essential in system administration.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Reflecting on your personal growth, what new knowledge, skills, or
perspectives did you gain from this course?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
> Through these challenging activities, I gained a deeper understanding of how monitoring systems and web servers operate. Configuring the server-client interaction for the web page taught me the importance of precision and attention to detail in network setups. I also developed patience and persistence when faced with technical difficulties. The experience showed me the value of collaborating with classmates and seeking guidance when needed. Additionally, I now appreciate how critical these systems are in real-world IT environments, even though the tasks were frustrating at times.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How do you plan to apply what you have learned in this course to your
future studies, career, or personal life?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
> The knowledge and skills I gained from these challenging activities will be instrumental in future projects. Understanding how to configure monitoring tools and web servers will be valuable in advanced IT courses and future career opportunities. Professionally, these skills can be applied in roles that require setting up and maintaining IT systems. On a personal level, this experience taught me how to approach problems systematically and remain resilient, which are lessons I can apply in many areas of life.
